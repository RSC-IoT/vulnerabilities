# Introduction

This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering reporting to PetSafe Brands regarding our internet-connected products (and related software), websites, or mobile applications. Please read this Policy fully before you report a vulnerability and always act in compliance with it.
We are committed to information security, and we appreciate those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities according to this Policy. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability disclosures.

# How to Report to Us

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability relating to our internet-connected products (and related software), websites, or mobile applications, please submit a vulnerability report to us via encrypted email to vulnerability@petsafe.com or via our secure webform. Reports may be submitted anonymously.
In your report, please include:
- The URL, product, or other location where the vulnerability can be observed;
- A brief description of the type of vulnerability and its potential impact; and
- A detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability.
The description of steps to reproduce the vulnerability should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept. This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately. It also reduces the likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation of some vulnerabilities.

# What to Expect

After you have submitted your report, if you provided your contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity, and exploit complexity.
We’ll aim to keep you informed of our progress, but some vulnerability reports might take some time to triage and address. For example, if we need to coordinate with third parties, this may extend the time required for assessment and mitigation. You are welcome to inquire about the status of your report, but please avoid doing so more than once every 14 days. This allows our teams to focus on the remediation. We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.
We ask that you treat the vulnerability as confidential until a solution has been implemented. Once your reported vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome your request for us to publicly recognize your contribution. We’d like to unify our public statements on resolved vulnerabilities, so please coordinate any desired public comments with us.

# Additional Requirements

The following activities are specifically prohibited:
- Breaking any applicable law and regulations
- Accessing unnecessary, excessive, or significant amounts of data
- Modifying data in our products, systems, or services
- Using high-intensity, invasive, or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities
- Attempting or reporting any form of denial of service (e.g., overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests)
- Engaging in denial of service attacks, load testing, social engineering, and other undesirable actions
- Disrupting our products, systems, or services 
- Submitting reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities 
- Submitting reports indicating that the products, systems, or services do not fully align with “best practice”
- Submitting reports detailing TLS configuration weaknesses (e.g., “weak” cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support)
- Communicating any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in this Policy
- Social engineering, phishing, or physically attacking our staff or infrastructure
- Demanding financial compensation in order to disclose any vulnerabilities
- Violating the privacy of any data we hold
- Sharing, distributing, or failing to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services

You must always comply with applicable laws and regulations, including all data protection requirements. This Policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability disclosure good practice. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law, or which might cause us to be in breach of any legal obligations.
You must securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).
